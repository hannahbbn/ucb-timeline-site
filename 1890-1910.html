                        Following years of calls from the public to open access to Berkeley’s excellent courses and programs,
University Extension came to life in 1891 when three professors crossed the Bay by ferry to offer
courses in San Francisco in history (Prof. Bacon), mathematics (Prof. Stringham) and English
literature (Prof. Gayley) 2 . These long awaited education opportunities were met with much
enthusiasm by the people of San Francisco, more than 800 people attended the first classes.
However, following the official approval of Extension by the Academic Senate in 1892, a financial
crisis hit the university and in 1893 the faculty was no longer able to provide courses to the public
without being offered any compensation.

                    In 1902, the Board of Regents made University Extension an autonomous department under the
                    leadership of the former Cornell history professor Henry Morse Stephens. Stephens was a fervent
                    supporter of the original ideology of university extension’s: “I am longing to try my hand on a great
                    Extension scheme on the Oxford line - I know I can do it and make a success of it.” In contrast to the
                    initial ‘free lectures’ model of Gayley and his colleagues, Stephens designed and organized lectures
                    to meet the needs and interests of adult professionals across the state. This model was operating
                    largely independently of the Academic Senate, used mainly non-faculty lecturers offering non-credit
                    courses, and was self-funded through a subscription model. With this extremely agile and
                    student-centric model, he created the fundamental concept of Continuing Education as we know it
                    today. The success of this model and his own energy, engagement and popularity, allowed
                    corresExtension to grow exponentially, reaching its peak of 15 centers around the state of California
                    in 1905. However, when Stephens continued his career with other university appointments after
                    1905, Extension activities declined until they ultimately ceased in 1910.
