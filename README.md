Title: UC Berkeley Timeline

Category: Web development

Target audience: general adult audiences, possibly college bound people

Background: This website will go through the many decades long history of UC Berkeley education. It will also include possible plans for the current/upcoming 2021 school year.

Design Problem: The assignment is to create a website cataloguing the past 130 years of instruction at UC Berkeley in a website. It should be easy to navigate, intuitive, and be responsive to desktop and mobile platforms. The website should also look visually appealing and the information should be the forefront of the experience. The design of the website should be seamless, meaning ideally almost unnoticeable unless one were paying direct attention to it.

Process: I rewatched several of the class recordings and used the internet to add to my html and css knowledge. I continuously looked at my prototypes for guidance to how I wanted the website to look. I had several problems many times with image resizing and floats commonly not working as I intended for them to.

Solution: I spent a long time searching the internet for tips on how to fix accessibility problems and other issues. Eventually, I was able to create a website that worked as I wanted.

Software: VS Code, Photoshop, AdobeXD, github
